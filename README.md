# Hi, I'm Shashwat

I'm a software developer with a focus on solving real-world problems through full-stack web development. Iâ€™ve built and deployed everything from queue management systems that cut transaction time in half, to production-ready websites and platforms for clients that prioritize performance and usability.

With experience across front-end and back-end technologies, I enjoy working on products that balance clean design, efficient architecture, and scalable infrastructure. Whether collaborating in a team or delivering solo freelance projects, I aim to write thoughtful, maintainable code that makes a measurable impact.

## Highlights
- Developed a custom token management system that improved workflow efficiency during peak hours
- Built a Python-based voice assistant to automate local tasks and streamline user productivity
- Delivered full-stack client projects with features like bookings, galleries, and performance-optimized SEO

## Tech Stack
